1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client Side:
    the whole page wonâ€™t refresh when using client-side routing. There are just some elements inside the application that will change.
Server Side:
    A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh. This is because a new GET request is sent to the server which responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page
